# Generative AI

It is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning models to generate new, original content based on patterns learned from massive amounts of training data. Unlike traditional AI systems that classify or predict existing data, Gen AI creates entirely new outputs such as text, images, code, audio, and video.

## Key Characteristics

- **General-Purpose Task Model**: Can perform multiple tasks without task-specific training
- **Trained on Massive Datasets**: Learns from billions of data points
- **Generative Capability**: Creates new, original content rather than just analyzing existing data
- **Probabilistic Learning**: Generates outputs based on learned probability distributions
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific applications
- **Contextual Understanding**: Understands nuance and context in data

## Core Technologies

- **Transformer Architecture**: Powers modern LLMs
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Text generation (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- **Diffusion Models**: Image generation (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Content generation
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Realistic synthetic media

## Common Use Cases

- Text generation and summarization
- Image and video creation
- Code generation and completion
- Music and audio synthesis
- Creative writing and content creation
- Data augmentation
