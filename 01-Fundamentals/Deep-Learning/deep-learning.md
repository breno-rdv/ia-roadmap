# Deep Learning
It is a field from Artificial Intelligence, actually a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with mulitple layers (hence "deep") to learn representation of data.
It is inspired by how the human brain processes information.

## Features
- Neural Networks with Multiple Layers: Input → Hidden Layers → Output Layer
- Automatic Feature Extraction: Learns features without manual engineering
- Non-linear Transformations: Captures complex patterns in data
- High Computational Power: Requires GPUs/TPUs for training
- Large Data Requirements: Performs better with massive datasets

### Use Cases
- Computer Vision: Image classification, object detection, facial recognition
- Natural Language Processing: Machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis
- Speech Recognition: Audio transcription, voice assistants
- Recommendation Systems: Netflix, Spotify, Amazon recommendations
- Autonomous Systems: Self-driving cars, robotics
- Healthcare: Medical image analysis, drug discovery

### Connection to Generative AI
Deep Learning is the foundation of Generative AI:

- Transformer Architecture: Powers modern LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude)
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Use deep neural networks to generate text
- Diffusion Models: Generate images (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
- Encoder-Decoder Models: Translate and summarize content
- Pre-training & Fine-tuning: Deep learning enables transfer learning for Gen AI
- Gen AI leverages deep learning's ability to learn complex patterns and generate new, creative content by predicting the next token/pixel based on learned representations.
