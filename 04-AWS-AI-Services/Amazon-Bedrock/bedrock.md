# Amazon Bedrock

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed AWS service that provides access to a variety of high-performing Foundation Models (FMs) from leading AI companies (such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and Amazon itself) through a single API.

## Key Features

- **Model Access**: Choose from a variety of FMs, including LLMs and Multimodal models, without managing any infrastructure.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Customize a base FM with your own data to adapt it for specific tasks, creating a private custom model.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Connect FMs to your own knowledge bases (via Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases) to generate responses grounded in your data.
- **Agents**: Build AI agents that can execute multi-step tasks by connecting to APIs and data sources.
- **Serverless**: No infrastructure to manage. You pay only for what you use.
- **Security & Privacy**: Models are private to your AWS account. Your data is not used to train the base models.
